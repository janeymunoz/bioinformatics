# bioinformatics
_A set of tools for the acquisition and analysis of biological data._

This repository contains the tools I have made as an amatuer/aspiring bioinformatician and coder! Although the functions of these tools can likely be found in existing sources, I felt that it would be beneficial to have a go at creating my own, since I could benefit from the coding experience. 

The bulk of the repository is housed in the [biotools](biotools) folder, where there are scripts that: 
- Aquire online genomics data
- Parse mass genomic data files (FASTA format) and return usable, accurate representations of data
- Transform genomic data (e.g., reverse complement, RNA codon to amino acid, etc)
- Perform calculations on data (e.g., GC content, Ti/Tv ratio, etc)

The [chemtools](chemtools) folder includes scripts that:
- Parse a string representing a molecule into is subparts (i.e., elements and subscripts)
- Calculate the molecular weight of a molecule
- Return information on atomic weight and atomic number

The [mathtools](mathtools) folder includes scripts that perform basic mathematical calculations (e.g., factorial, permutation count)
